# Memorial

We lost a sheeptagger in 2020. RIP to grim.shadow, who tragically passed away due to alcohol poisoning. May he forever be remembered as a member of the community. Many people discredit his skill due to blatant map hacking, but in our eyes he was a respected member of the community. May he rest in peace.
